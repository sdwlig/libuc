<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>UCContract provides a means to evaluate a given UniversalContainer object
against an arbitrary contract, and determining if it matches that contract. The
primary intent is to provide an easy means of checking incoming JSON objects
to ensure they are formatted as expected, but it can also be used to verify
objects on deserialization, post requests, or as a means of checking other input.</p>

<h2>Describing a Contract</h2>
<p>Instances of UCContract are created from UniversalContainers
describing the contract. Contract descriptors are maps which contain
the key "type". This key must map to a string designating the type of
UniversalContainer the contract describes. Other members of the contract description
are optional, and dependent on the type. If present, these members
restrict the range of possible values that the given element may take on.</p>

  <tr>
      <td>User Defined</td>
      <td>If the type is not one of the types listed above, it is

  </tr>
</table></p>

 
<p>UCContract allows for the definition of user types. If the provided type
type parameter is not one of the values listed above, UCContract consults a
hidden, library of named UCContact objects for a match. If a match is
found the contract object will reference that contrat when doing compare
operations. The library is initially empty, but types can be added to 
the library with the static method add_to_library. Note that the reference
to the type library is established when the contract is constructed,
not during the comparision.  If you have a contract that references another
contract by name you must add the named contract to the library before you do
the comparison. Circular references are not possible.</p>

<p>When a contract is created any required regex is compiled and saved
for later use. Otherwise, creating a new instance of UCContract is not
terribly expensive. However, in most cases it will involve
deserializing the UniversalContainer describing the contract; most
likely from some JSON source. This can be expensive, especially if it
involves an I/O operation.</p>

<p>Recommended usage of UCContract is to do all loading of contracts that will
  be needed during a programs lifetime at once, adding each one to global
  contract library with add_to_library. Then, during program operation,
  use the provided static methods to check objects against contracts by
  their named types.</p>

<p>UCContract conforms to the UniversalContainer metadata contract, and
  ignores any field in a map which begins with a hash mark (#).</p>


<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Below is an example of a contract description in JSON, showing how
to use the various elements. To use a contract like this, you would
first deserialize the JSON to a UniversalContainer using
uc_decode_json, and then pass the resulting UC to the constructor for
a UCContract object.</p>

<pre>
{
    "type" : "map",
    "required_members" : {
	"name" : {
	    "type" : "string",
	    "regex" : "[A-Z][a-z]*\\ [A-Z][a-z]"
	},
	"age" : {
	    "type" : "integer",
	    "lower_bound" : 18
	},
	"manager" : { 
	    "type" : "boolean"
	},
	"sex" : {

	"email" : {

<h2>Constructor</h2>
<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method">UCContract(UniversalContainer& uc)</h3>
<p>Creates a new UCContract object from the description provided by
  the UniversalContainer uc. See explanation above.</p>
</div>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method"> unsigned compare(const UniversalContainer& uc)
  const</h3>
<h3 class="method"> static unsigned compare(std::string const& type, 
  const UniversalContainer& uc) const</h3>
  <p>Compares the container uc against the contract, and returns 0 if
  uc matches the contract. A non-zero return value indicates one or
  more violations of the contract; depending on which bits of the
  return code are set. Note that in the case of arrays and maps, there
  is no indication of which element caused a particular flag to be
  set, and there may be multiple violations of the same type. The following
  table details the various masks which can be ANDed with the return code
  to determine which errors occured.</p>

  <p>The static version compares a container against a named type previously
    added to the contract library with add_to_library. If the named type does
    not exist in the library the result is ucc_IMPROPER_TYPE.</p>

  <table class="dictionary">
    <tr>
      <td>ucc_IMPROPER_TYPE</td>
      <td>The container or one or more of its elements has the wrong data type.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ucc_CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION</td>
      <td>The value of the container violates the constraints
	specified in the contract. This is also the flag that signals
    an array that has violated its size constraints, or for which some
    element has violated that forall constraint.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ucc_EXTRA_MAP_ELEMENT</td>
      <td>A map contains one or more elements that are not specified in as required or optional.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ucc_MISSING_REQUIRED_MAP_ELEMENT</td>
      <td>A map is missing an element that is marked as required.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ucc_MISSING_REQUIRED_ARRAY_ELEMENT</td>
      <td>An array does not contain an element that is specified in
    the exists constraint.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ucc_STRING_DOES_NOT_MATCH</td>
      <td>Some string does not match the given regex expression.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method">void compare_and_throw(UniversalContainer&, unsigned = 0XFFFFFFFF) const</h3>
<h3 class="method">static void compare_and_throw(std::string const& name, UniversalContainer&, unsigned = 0XFFFFFFFF) const</h3>
  <p>This method calls compare on the given container, and performs an
  or operation between the mask and the result of the compare
  operation. If the final result is non-zero then a UniversalContainer
  is thrown as an <a
  href="UniversalContainer.html#exceptions">exception</a>. The
  resulting exception has the code key set to
  uce_ContractViolation, and the key compare_result set to the value
  of the compare operation ored with the mask. The key violations
  maps to an array of strings containing the same messages produced by
  the error_messages method.</p>

  <p>The static version compares a container against a named type previously
  added to the contract library with add_to_library. If the named type does
  not exist in the library the result is ucc_IMPROPER_TYPE.</p>
  </div>

<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method">static std::vector &lt;const char*&gt; error_messages(unsigned result)</h3>
  <p>When passed a result code, this method will return a vector of
  error messages in English matching the flags sets in the
  result. This is a utility method to make debugging easier.</p>
</div>

<div class="method_div">
 <h3 class="method">static void add_to_library(std::string const& name, 
  UniversalContainer& contract);</h3>

 <p>This static method adds the contract defined by the container contract to the global
  type library. It causes a new contract to be created, but this contract is stored in
  the library rather than being returned to the user. Calling this method with the a name
  previously added to the library will replace previous entry in the library and delete the
  previous contract. This will break any currently existing contracts that reference the old
  entry; and seg faults are likely to follow.
