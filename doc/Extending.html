<h1>Extending UniversalContainer</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Consider the problem of enabling UniversalContainer to hold a new data type.
Deriving a new child class has the advantage that the casting and assignment operators
can be overridden to understand the new type. But in practice this proves tricky,
since the new class must know when to handle the new type, and when to delegate back
to the parent to handle previously understood types. And consider what happens when
two children, possibly from different sources, add support for two new types,
but the need is for one type that can contain everything of interest. Instead,
UniversalContainer takes another approach, and allows for extension to registered.
By making the addition of new types orthogonal to the class itself, multiple types
can be added independent of each other.</p>

<p>UniversalContainer provides a special constructor which allows it to hold
an arbitrary reference (a void*), with a designated type attached. Before
this constructor is used, however, the new type must be registered by with
an instance of a class called UniversalContainerTypeAdaptor. A second
method, cast_or_throw, allows for that reference to be retrieved in a type safe
way. To enable UniversalContainer to understand new types, you must first
provide a new concrete implementation of UniversalContainerTypeAdapter.
Second, register an instance of this class using the provide static
registration function to get a new type id. Then, use this type id
to add and retrieve values of the new type from a UniversalContainer.
The registered UniversalContainerTypeAdapter will handle memory
management, cloning, and string conversion for your type.</p>

<p>In practice, there are a number of tricks that can be used
to make using UniversalContainer with your newly supported type
easier. It is highly recommended that you look at the code
in the file example_adapter.cpp, and base your new adapter type
off that code. You can also look at buffer_adapter.cpp for
a complete example.</p>

<h2>Using UniversalContainer With New Types</h2>
<p>The downside of extending UniversalContainer in this manner
is that the casting and assignment operators can not be
overloaded to accept understand the new type. In practice,
this can be dealt with by creating an overloaded assign and
cast functions that do the work of casting and assigning values
to a UniversalContainer. The example file gives an example
of how to do this.</p>

<h2>UniversalContainerTypeAdapter</h2>

<p>UniversalContainerTypeAdapter is an abstract class
  declared in ucontainer.h. Instances of this class
  are responsible for adapting UniversalContainer to
  understand new reference types. When UniversalContainer
  is holding a reference to a type it does not understand
  natively, it will invoked the registered adapter to
  handle various tasks. The reference in question will
  always be sent as the ptr parameter.
</p>

<h2 class="include">#include "ucontainer.h"</h2>
<div class="code_example">
<pre>
  struct UniversalContainerTypeAdapter {
    virtual std::string to_string(void*) = 0;  
    virtual void* clone(void*) = 0;
    virtual void on_delete(void*) = 0;
    virtual std::string to_json(void*) = 0;

    virtual ~UniversalContainerTypeAdapter(void) {}
  };
</pre>
</div>

<div class="method_div">
  <h3 class="method">virtual ~UniversalContainerTypeAdapter(void)</h3>
  <p>Since most (virtually all) UniversalContainerTypeAdapters will
  	not have state, the default empty implementation of this method
  	should suffice. But if your implementation has state, this is the
    place to clean up. Note that this method will only be invoked
    when the program terminates.</p>
 </div>

<div class="method_div">
  <h3 class="method">virtual std::string to_string(void* ptr)</h3>
  <p>This is the method that will eventually be invoked when to_string
  	is called on a UniversalContainer holding an adapted type. It should 
  	return a string representing the data pointed to by ptr in string form.</p>
 </div>

 <div class="method_div">
  <h3 class="method">virtual void* clone(void* ptr)</h3>
  <p>This the method that is invoked when a container holding the adapted type
  	is cloned. You should return a pointer to a new but identical copy of
  	the data reference by ptr. The returned reference will be owned by the
  	UniversalContainer that holds the clone.</p>
 </div>

 <div class="method_div">
  <h3 class="method">virtual void on_delete(void* ptr)</h3>
  <p>UniversalContainer does reference counting when passing or copying
  	a container. When the last UniversalContainer holding a particular reference
  	of the adapted type is deleted, this method will be invoked to cleanup the reference.
  	This method should delete or free ptr as appropriate.</p>
 </div>

 <div class="method_div">
  <h3 class="method">virtual std::string to_json(void* ptr)</h3>
  <p>The JSON encoder will invoke this method when it encounters an
  	adapted typed. It should return a string with the JSON representation
  	of the object referenced by ptr. Note that UniversalContainer already
  	understands everything that can normally be placed into a json object,
  	and no mechanism is provided to extend the JSON parser to decode new types.
    The provided default version of this method just returns the string NULL,
    which will not break standard JSON parsers and should be suitable in cases
    where an object has no JSON representation.</p>
