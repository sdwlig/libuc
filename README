This is the libuc library, by Jason Denton. This library provides the
UniversalContainer class, which is a C++ class that attempts to mimic
the general purpose dictionaries of many popular scripting languages.
Included are variety of routines for REST style web programming, and
for database manipulation. This library is covered by the new BSD
license, see the LICENSE file for details. To build the library, run
the configure script then make. The file doc/index.html is the
starting point for the documentation.
